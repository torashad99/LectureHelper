1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
you

2
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.280
in this lecture we're going to talk

3
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.930
about the text access in the previous

4
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.000
lecture we talked about the natural

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.850
remedy content analysis we explained

6
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.460
that the state-of-the-art natural remedy

7
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.680
processing techniques are still not good

8
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.560
enough to process a lot of unrestricted

9
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.190
text data in a robust manner as a result

10
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.430
bag-of-words recognition remains very

11
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.890
popular in applications neither search

12
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.130
engines in this lecture we're going to

13
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.340
talk about some high-level strategies to

14
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.200
help users get access to the text data

15
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.790
this is also an important step to

16
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.300
convert raw big text data into small

17
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.940
random in the data that are actually

18
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.690
needed in a specific application so the

19
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.420
main question you address here is how

20
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.729
can a text information system help users

21
00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.770
get access to the realm in the text data

22
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.229
we're going to cover two complementary

23
00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.830
strategies push versus pull and then

24
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.200
we're going to talk about two ways to

25
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.049
implement the poor mode query

26
00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.520
versus browsing so first push versus

27
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.820
poor these are two different ways to

28
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.100
connect the users with the right

29
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.220
information at the right time the

30
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.280
difference is which takes the initiative

31
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.430
which party takes the initiative in the

32
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.710
poor mode the users would take the

33
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.710
initiative to start the information

34
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.549
access process and in this case a user

35
00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.979
typically would use a search engine to

36
00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.170
fulfill the goal for example the user

37
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.470
may type in the query and then browse

38
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.920
the results to find the relevant

39
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.950
information so this is really

40
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.149
appropriate for satisfying users of

41
00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.599
information in an acting formation

42
00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.459
either is a temporary information need

43
00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.810
for example you want to buy a product so

44
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.840
you'll suddenly have a need

45
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.840
to read reviews about related products

46
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.150
but after you have collected information

47
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.640
have purchased your product you

48
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.019
generally no longer need a such

49
00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.370
information so it's a temporary

50
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.220
information needed in such a case it's

51
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.959
very hard for a system to predict to

52
00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.690
your need and it's more appropriate for

53
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.849
the users to take the initiative and

54
00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.280
that's why search engines are very

55
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.890
useful today because many people have

56
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.280
many other information needs all the

57
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.760
time

58
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.880
so as we're speaking Google properties

59
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.650
process in many queries from us and

60
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.290
those are all or mostly arrow

61
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.650
information needs so this is the poor

62
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.260
mode in contrast in the push mode the

63
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.870
system would take the initiative to push

64
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.400
the information to the user or to

65
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.680
recommend information to the user so in

66
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.959
this case this is usually supported by a

67
00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.650
recommender system now this would be

68
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.319
appropriate if the user has a stable

69
00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.680
information for example you may have a

70
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.170
research interest in some topic and that

71
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.019
interest tends to stay for a while so

72
00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.540
it's relatively stable your hobby is

73
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.150
another example of a stable information

74
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.790
need in such a case the system can

75
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.680
interact with you and can learn your

76
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.019
interest and then can monitor the

77
00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.200
information stream if it is the system

78
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.049
has seen in irrelevant items to you

79
00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.090
interest the system could then take the

80
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.220
initiative to recommend information to

81
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.010
you so for example a news filter or news

82
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.840
recommender system could monitor the

83
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.880
news stream and identify interesting

84
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.040
news to you and simply push the news

85
00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.599
articles to you this mode of information

86
00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.510
access may be also appropriate when the

87
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.250
system has good knowledge about the

88
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.380
users need and this happens in the

89
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.900
search context so for example when you

90
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.209
search for information on the web a

91
00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.489
search engine might infer you might be

92
00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:15.780
also interesting some related

93
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.660
information and they would recommend in

94
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.550
from

95
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.550
so that should remind you for example

96
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:26.680
advertisement place the research of age

97
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.070
so this is about the two high level

98
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.740
strategies or two modes of texture

99
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.310
access now let's look at the poor mode

100
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.360
in more detail in the poor mode we can

101
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.040
further distinguish in two ways to help

102
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.370
users query versus browsing the inquiry

103
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.130
a user would just end up query typically

104
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.140
keyword query and the search engine

105
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.970
system would return randomly documents

106
00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.180
to users and this works well when the

107
00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.420
user knows what exactly are the keywords

108
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.790
to be used so if you know exactly what

109
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.380
you're looking for you tend to know the

110
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.630
right keywords and then query will work

111
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.380
very well and we do that all the time

112
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.210
but we also know that sometimes it

113
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.460
doesn't work so well when you don't know

114
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.650
the right keywords reduce in the query

115
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.130
or you want to browse information in

116
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.820
some topic area in this case browsing

117
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.870
would be more useful so in this case in

118
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.610
the case of browsing the users would

119
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.710
simply navigate into the relevant

120
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.240
information by following the path is

121
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.080
supported by the structures on documents

122
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.750
so the system would maintain some kind

123
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.340
of structures and then the user could

124
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.420
follow these structures to navigate so

125
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.060
this strategy works well when the user

126
00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.370
wants to explore the information space

127
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.960
or the user doesn't know what are the

128
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.230
keywords to use in the query or simply

129
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.860
because the user finds it inconvenient

130
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.990
to type in a query so even if a user

131
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.240
knows what query to type in if the user

132
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.570
is using a cellphone to search for

133
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.100
information then it's still hard to

134
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.650
enter the query in such a case again

135
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.860
browsing tends to be more convenient the

136
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.930
relationship between browsing and the

137
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.880
query is best understood by making

138
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.670
analogy to the sightseeing imagining if

139
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.470
you are touring the city now if you know

140
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.199
the exact address of attraction then

141
00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:33.539
taking a taxi there is perhaps the

142
00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:35.789
fastest way and you can go directly to

143
00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:38.009
the site but if you don't know the exact

144
00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:40.379
address you may need to walk around or

145
00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:42.509
you can take a taxi to a nearby place

146
00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:45.210
and then walk around it turns out that

147
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.159
we do exact the same in the information

148
00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:49.319
space if you know exactly what you are

149
00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:51.870
looking for then you can use the right

150
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.849
keywords in your query to finally

151
00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:55.979
implement in directory that's usually

152
00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:58.580
the fastest way to do final information

153
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.960
but what if you don't know the exact

154
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.240
keywords to use well your query probably

155
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.099
won't work so well you will end on some

156
00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:07.259
related pages and then you need to also

157
00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:09.379
walk around in the information space

158
00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:13.199
meaning by following the links or by

159
00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.479
browsing you can then finally get into

160
00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:18.569
the relevant page if you want to learn

161
00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:21.569
about topic again you know what you will

162
00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:24.960
likely do a lot of browsing so just like

163
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.779
you are looking around in some area and

164
00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:30.659
you want to see some interesting

165
00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:36.180
attractions in a related in the same

166
00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:41.069
region so this analogy also tells us

167
00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:44.969
that today we have very good spot for

168
00:07:44.969 --> 00:07:48.539
query but we don't really have good spot

169
00:07:48.539 --> 00:07:52.409
for browsing and this is because in

170
00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:54.810
order to browse effectively we need a

171
00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.599
map to guide us just like you need a map

172
00:07:57.599 --> 00:07:59.219
of Chicago the two of the city of

173
00:07:59.219 --> 00:08:02.159
Chicago you need a copula map to tour

174
00:08:02.159 --> 00:08:04.379
the information space so how to

175
00:08:04.379 --> 00:08:06.749
construct such a topic map is in fact a

176
00:08:06.749 --> 00:08:09.259
very interesting research question that

177
00:08:09.259 --> 00:08:13.560
likely will bring us more interesting

178
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.439
browsing spans on the web or in other

179
00:08:16.439 --> 00:08:20.520
applications so to summarize this

180
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.139
lecture we have talked about the two

181
00:08:22.139 --> 00:08:24.599
high-level strategies for texture access

182
00:08:24.599 --> 00:08:27.659
push and pour push tends to be supported

183
00:08:27.659 --> 00:08:29.759
by recommender system and poor tends to

184
00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:31.289
be supported by a search engine of

185
00:08:31.289 --> 00:08:33.360
course in a sophisticated

186
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.760
inheriting the information system we

187
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.329
should combine the two in the poor mode

188
00:08:39.329 --> 00:08:40.580
we can further this movie

189
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.980
query and browsing again we generally

190
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.340
want to combine the two ways to help

191
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.040
users so that you can support both query

192
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.220
and browsing if you want to know more

193
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.190
about the relationship between poor and

194
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:58.670
push you can read this article this

195
00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:00.890
gives excellent discussion of the

196
00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.240
relationship between information

197
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.420
filtering and information retrieval here

198
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.550
information filtering is similar to

199
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.130
information recommendation or the push

200
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.660
mode of information access
